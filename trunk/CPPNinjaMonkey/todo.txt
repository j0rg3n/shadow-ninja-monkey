Find workaround for VC2010 containing conflicting bind implementation: 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\include\xxbind1: 'std::tr1::_Bind<_Result_type,_Ret,_BindN> ...

Try to implement DXInput (multiple) mouse input. (Needed for testing network on single machine.) 
If costly, implement rudimentary windows message-based mouse and keyboard input.

Work on design of input binding, i.e. binding relative input axes (controllers), absolute input positions (mouse, touch screen), button presses to game action basis.

Work on design of "gesture input": Prod to screen gives ordinary waypoint (or replaces the existing waypoint), to which ninja will run. Drag indicates attack (ninja will run for the starting point of the drag, then run along the drag until max attack length is reached).
